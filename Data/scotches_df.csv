I enjoy Laphroaig 10, love the heck out of Laphroaig Cask Strength, and my favourite is a Lagavulin 16. I\'ll also move out of Islay with a Glenfiddich 15, a Macallan 12, or a Glenmorangie. All of those offerings list an age on the bottle (the youngest being 10), and the An Oa has burned me on the concept of buying another Scotch of undeclared age. This tasted young - I\'d be stunned if it was over 5 - and therefore not nearly as smooth as I\'m accustomed to. I still gave it several goes, trying to find what would work. I tried it neat, lightly watered, moderately watered, ""why did you put so much water in it"" watered; I tried it immediately after the pour, after sitting for 10 minutes, for 20 minutes, for ""Oops I forgot I poured scotch"" minutes; I tried it room temperature, I tried it chilled, I tried it served up. Nothing helped. It\'s simply not as mellow as an older scotch, I haven\'t drunk anything that bitey in quite a while. I was a bit shocked at the difference, to be honest. Which is a shame, because the flavour wasn\'t awful or anything. Another review said it was like a Laphroaig 10, and they\'re not wrong. I\'m wondering if people are equating the lightness of the flavours as smoothness? Because to me, they were just muted. It tasted like there was maybe some passable scotch underneath a layer of ethanol. It tasted... like the title says, watered down. It\'s like if I poured a measure of unflavoured vodka or the like into a Laphroaig 10. So yeah, I just couldn\'t get over the ethanol-heavy weak flavour of the An Oa. When I transitioned from Laphroaig 10 to Laphroaig Cask Strength for a daily drinker, I found it hard to go back to the 10. It just tasted so watered down in comparison. That\'s what the An Oa is like to me, in comparison with Laphroaig 10. Except way less smooth on top of that.I\'ll be giving that bottle away, there\'s no way I\'ll drink through it.

The first three, are on my ""regulars"" list, so no surprise that I love this stuff.Compass Box is unique in their transparency regarding what goes into their products.  If you go to their website you will find recipe details along with information about what specific type of wood they used for each element.  Most independent bottlers leave us guessing.  This is a nice touch.The nose is quite peaty -- a mix of Caol Ila campfire and Laphroaig\'s intense smoke with iodine/medicinal notes  -- but there are also some light marine, fruit and floral characteristics in there, as well. The latter characteristics come out to play more prominently in the taste.  This is not a one-trick donkey, as the product name implies.  After the initial peaty hit, there is quite a bit of complexity going on.  Compared to single malts, it quite similar to Ardbeg 10, which in my opinion is currently far and away the best value in Islay whisky.Top shelf ingredients go into this whisky, but the finished product is even better than the sum of its parts.

My wife poured 2 & I decided which I preferred.  Then I continued to compare 2 & identify my preference (I was very impressed with Glenmorangie Original so I added 3 more Glenmorangie to the mix).  This continued over several months with many comparisons until I finalized my preference list & here it is:\n1.\t Glenmorangie La Santa ($56.99)\n2.\tDalmore 12 yr ($64.99)\n3.\tGlenmorangie Nectar D’or ($72.99)\n4.\tGlenmorangie Original ($33.99)\n5.\tGrangestone 18 yr ($59.99)\n6.\tGlenlivet 12 yr ($29.99)\n7.\tGrangestone 12 yr ($32.99)\n8.\tMcCallan 12 yr ($56.99)\n9.\tGlenmorangie Quinta Ruban ($45.99)\n10.\tGlen Ness 12 yr ($27.99)\nChoices 1-3 are excellent choices for that special treat, Choices 4-8 are very good as your regular selection & choices 9-10 are so-so (I eliminated 9 & 10 from my stock list).\nI hope this provides a good starting point and you do taste tests to identify your preferences.

Tannins are nice and add a nice dark chocolate note. The spirit is Dalmore, which on it's own is quite unique and interesting. Good quality stuff here, but in my opinion, best presented with no E150 colouring (as apposed to standard bottlings which are loaded with the stuff), non-chill filtering (same), and at cask strength 53% ABV (as apposed to the anemic 40 %).Dalmore deserves to be appreciated without being diminished by mainstream marketing gimmicks. This version by exclusive casks releases it for that appreciation well.

Yes it is, but nothing going on, this is exactly  what someone who doesn’t know about scotch whould expect. At the nose first 2 minutes only strong green apples and some vanilla in the background, after 3-4 more minutes, nose changes in matured sweet pear, but nothing else. The taste follows the nose, with a little more “creamy” character. Not overly sweet, but not overly nothing. Finish is short. To me at light lower prices there are much better blends very more complex than this, like Jw gold or the green.

I normally enjoy talisker 10, caol ila 12, and double black as a form of blend for everyday. I appreciate the difference from a blend and a single malt, but I have to say, this is a ""boungus"" whisky (yes WHISKY not SCOTCH, it is still a whisky my friends, not whiskey!) the grain is minimal, the creaminess is over the top, on the nose and palate: vanilla, fudge, cocoa, dark fruits, smoke, white pepper, nuts, it IS delicious. Yes it is a blend, bottled at 40%, a ""conversational"" whisky, not a pungent/punchy one that wakes you up, but lightly strokes your cheeks and your throat, in a sweet dream in heaven. I would spend this 80 dollars every day over a glennfiddich 21 (SINGLE MALT) and everything else, because, even if a blend, it is very complex and easy going at the same time, to me, better than the Blue. Only suggestion, open the bottle and let it breath for 5-6 days, at half way, its getting the best. Mystic flavor and taste. ', 'review_scor': '5'}}"

In learning about Mizunara Oak I've come to find out that it take really long time to age whisky in this type of oak in order for the flavor to develop. My guess is that this whisky has not aged very long at all which reflects in complete lack of flavor and character. The label and distiller's website is very vague as well which I assume is intentional to hide low quality or product that is rushed to consumer. This is bargain quality whisky being sold for premium price solely based on uniqueness and rarity of Mizunara Oak.

Short story: if you like Laphroaig, like myself, you will appreciate Lore. It\'s more rounded and subdued in it\'s medicinal peat allotment than it\'s young, brash siblings. It\'s quite rich, oily and viscous. It feels thick and weighted in your mouth. The peat is more relaxed than in the 10 year old, and it\'s complimented by hints of Sherry and quarter cask maturation. I do sense the older Laphroaig being used, which leads to Lore\'s more rounded and sophisticated flavour. If you\'re an ardent fan of Laphroaig, I think Lore is worth having around. It certainly does enough to separate itself from the rest of the lineup. It is more mature and rounded than either the 10 or QC, and it\'s less sweet and more complex than the triple wood. I\'d prefer a similarly priced 18 year old, but given the times we live in, such NAS renditions are a fact of life. As it stands, I think this Lore is a very respectable and worthwhile Laphroiag.

It's not as smokey as Ardbeg and the other Islay malt peat monsters, but it's certainly prevalent. Right alongside the smoke however, comes a luscious fruitiness and enough complexity to earn your respect. I've not tried Tobermoray, but I have grown quite fond of this Ledaig. Highly recommended if you enjoy smokey Scotches, and certainly worth trying if you haven't expanded your horizons from Islay in a while, and/or if you're a fan of Springbank. This is one fine Scotch whisky in my humble opinion, and well worth the $50.00 I paid for it; I will be re-purchasing in the future. In fact, it may have earned a spot on my regular stable alongside the likes of Ardbeg, Lagavulin, Laphroaig, Springbank, Bruichladdich, Bunnahabain... the list goes on, but you get the point.Cheers!

It has the weirdest flavor that I can\'t quite describe. I like Auchentoshan, but it really pays to get the distillery bottling labeled ""Classic,"" which is their entry-level bottling, rather than this poorly executed independent bottling. I\'m not sure what McClelland\'s did to ruin this whisky, but they succeeded.Tastes like it has been aged about 5 or 6 years and has a mostly sour lemon and sickly sweet, corn-syrupy flavor, followed by some weird, almost rancid flavor that I can\'t describe. In my opinion, most malt whisky shouldn\'t be drunk before 8 years as a single or blended (vatted) malt, but young malt is okay in a blend. This one would definitely gain quite a bit from a few more years in the cask. I tend to be able to appreciate a wide variety of flavors, whether the spirit is cheap or expensive, but this one strikes me as foul. I plan on blending it with some grain-heavy blended whisky and aging it in a small, 2 Liter oak cask, to see if that helps.I also made the mistake of buying the McClelland\'s Islay (a young Bowmore) rather than just going straight for the Bowmore Legend. It is better than the Lowland, but still bad. My advice is to go straight ahead and purchase the entry-level distillery bottlings over this garbage. I can\'t even drink McClelland\'s Lowland on a heap of ice without wishing it were even a cheap blend.I don\'t mean to be harsh with my review, as I usually am not, but sometimes you just get a bad one.

On the taste, about the only thing I got was barbeque smoke and even a little charcoal note going into the finish.  There might be other flavors hiding in there, but the smoky quality totally dominates (for me).It could definitely be the case that this only has a medium smokiness and I'm just not used to it.  It does add a unique quality that you don't get in other whiskies and I can see why people like it.
